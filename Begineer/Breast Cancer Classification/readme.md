# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Classification  

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Breast Cancer Classification system** that predicts whether a breast tumor is **benign** (non-cancerous) or **malignant** (cancerous). It is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **data visualization tools**, with the goal of assisting in early diagnosis and decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Preprocessing of breast cancer dataset (handling missing values, normalization, encoding).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations for feature understanding.  
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Model evaluation using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **ROC-AUC curve**.  
- Easily extendable for deployment via **Flask/Django API** or **Streamlit dashboard**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)) or can be accessed via `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`.

- **Features:** 30 real-valued input features computed from digitized images of a breast mass.  
- **Target:**  
  - `0` â†’ Malignant (Cancerous)  
  - `1` â†’ Benign (Non-cancerous)
