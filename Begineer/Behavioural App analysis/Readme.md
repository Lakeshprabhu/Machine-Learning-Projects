ðŸ“Š Behavioral App Analysis

This project analyzes user behavior within an app to uncover insights such as usage patterns, engagement levels, and predictors of user retention. The workflow includes preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

ðŸš€ Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Feature engineering (e.g., time differences, categorical encodings)

Predictive modeling (classification/regression, depending on task)

Model evaluation using accuracy .

Exporting results for reporting and visualization

ðŸ“Š Example Results

EDA: User activity peaks at 9AM and 7PM.

Feature importance: Session length and time-to-first-open are strong predictors of retention.

Model performance: Logistic Regression achieved 87% accuracy on the test set.



ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Python 3.8+

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

jupyter

ðŸ”® Future Work

Incorporate deep learning models for sequence behavior analysis

Add dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly Dash) for real-time behavioral insights

Integrate A/B testing framework
