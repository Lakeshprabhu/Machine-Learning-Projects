📘 Project Overview
This tutorial walks through the complete process of building a beginner-friendly machine learning project using Google Colab. We'll cover everything from formulating a hypothesis and preparing data to training a model and evaluating its performance.

To make things engaging, we use data from historical Olympic Games to build a model that predicts how many medals a country is likely to win — based on both past and current data.

By the end of this project, you'll understand the full machine learning workflow and how to implement it end-to-end using Python, Colab, and commonly used ML libraries.

🔄 Machine Learning Workflow
Machine learning projects typically follow a consistent structure. This tutorial follows that same structure to help build your foundation for tackling future ML problems.

✅ Project Steps
Formulate a hypothesis

Locate and explore the dataset

(If needed) Reshape the data for the prediction task

Clean and preprocess the data

Choose an error metric

Split the dataset into training and test sets

Train and evaluate a model

💻 Code Files
This project was developed in Google Colab and includes the following notebooks:

machine_learning.ipynb — Main notebook implementing the ML pipeline

data_prep.ipynb — Helper notebook for converting raw athlete-level data into team-level summaries

⚙️ Running the Project in Colab
No local installation is required! You can run the project entirely in the cloud using Google Colab. Simply open the notebooks directly via the Colab links provided in this repository.

However, if you prefer to run it locally, you'll need:

🐍 Local Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

Required Python packages:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

seaborn

📊 Data Sources
The data used in this project is derived from historical Olympic Games data, originally sourced from Kaggle.

Files used:

teams.csv — Cleaned and processed team-level dataset used in the ML model
