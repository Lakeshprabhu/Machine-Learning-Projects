ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
This project demonstrates the classification of the famous Iris Flower dataset using four popular machine learning algorithms:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width
