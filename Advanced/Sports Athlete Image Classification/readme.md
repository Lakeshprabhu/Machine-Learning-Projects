# 🏆 Personnel Classification (Example : - Sports Athlete Classification)

A **machine learning–based personnel classification system**, demonstrated through a fun example that classifies images of famous **sports personalities** — **Mike Tyson**, **Cristiano Ronaldo**, **Lionel Messi**, **Maria Sharapova**, and **Virat Kohli**.

The project showcases how **computer vision** and **machine learning** can be used to recognize individuals from image data. It uses **OpenCV** for image preprocessing, **Scikit-learn** for model training, and is deployed using **Flask** with a custom **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload an image to identify a sports personality  
- Automatic image preprocessing and feature extraction using OpenCV  
- Classification among five top athletes (Tyson, Ronaldo, Messi, Sharapova, Kohli)  
- Real-time prediction using a deployed ML model  
- Interactive web interface for user-friendly experience  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Scikit-learn / Machine Learning Model**
- **Flask** (Backend)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend)

---

## 📸 Usage
1. Launch the web app in your browser.  
2. Upload an image of a person (e.g., a sports celebrity).  
3. The app predicts and displays which of the five athletes the image matches.  

This project demonstrates the workflow of an **AI-based personnel classifier**, which can be extended to other domains such as employee recognition or security systems.

---

## 📊 Model Training
- Image preprocessing and feature extraction are done using **OpenCV**.  
- A labeled dataset of the five sports personalities is used for training.  
- Models such as **SVM**, **Random Forest**, or **Logistic Regression** are tested for best performance.  
- The trained model is serialized and deployed via Flask for real-time inference.

### 💡 Note
While this project uses sports celebrities as examples, the core framework is a **general-purpose personnel classification system**, applicable to various organizational and research contexts.
